# The VBA of Wall Street
![Stock Market](https://blog.galvanize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Can-data-science-predict-the-stock-market-.jpg)

## Challenge Instructions
This project utilizes VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data from 2014-2016.

## Stock Market Analyst
- Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The total stock volume of the stock
- Create conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red

## BONUS
- Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
- Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once (The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button!)

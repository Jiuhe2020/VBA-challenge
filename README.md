# The VBA of Wall Street
## Challenge Instructions
This project utilizes VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data from 2014-2016.

## Stock Market Analyst
- Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
  - The ticker symbol.
  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
- Create conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## BONUS
- Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
- Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
